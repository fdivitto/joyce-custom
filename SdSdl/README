  SDSDL is a graphics output library written in C++, based on the GPLed 
video driver source code of Digital Research's GEM. It uses SDL 
<http://www.libsdl.org/> as a backend; the assembly language portions have
been rewritten in C++.

  The current incarnation of SDSDL is incomplete. The only implemented 
functions are those necessary to support those functions present in GSX.
