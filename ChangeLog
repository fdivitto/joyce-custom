2017-07-07 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.2.12 release.

	 keys have different SDL keynumbers under Windows and Linux.

2017-02-12 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.2.11 release.

	* Further compilation fix: LyX changed export behaviour to write text
	 files with the extension .text, not .txt, meaning the .txt copies
	 of documentation in the distribution archive were out of date.

	* Option to use a single DPB for all drives implemented by 
	 JOYCEDRV.FID. This allows more than 6 emulated hard drives 
	 under CP/M.

2010-11-03 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.2.4 release.

	* Made the keyboard emulation more true to the original, with 
	 accurate emulation of bytes 3FFA-3FFF and support for the

2010-06-28 John Elliott

	* Updated the build scripts to work better with recent autotools
	 and removed a number of compiler warnings.

2010-06-12 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.2.3 release, and my apologies for leaving the fix below
	 sitting in my inbox for so long.

2009-11-22 Jacob Nevins

	* Compilation fixes for recent Ubuntu systems.

2009-01-12 John Elliott

	* A buffer overflow in lib765 was causing xanne to crash.

2007-12-28 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.2.0 release.

2007-04-30 John Elliott

	* Updated Kempston mouse emulation. The utilities supplied with
	 the Kempston mouse should now work.

2007-02-02 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.11 release.

2007-02-02 John Elliott

	* Fixed a bug in the emulation of EI that prevented Starglider from

2006-04-22 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.10 release.

2006-04-10 John Elliott

	* Fixed the support for PCKEY, which appears to be another feature
	 that went away in 2.0.0 and never came back.

2006-01-28 John Elliott

	* Updated the autoconf bits so that ./configure will detect MacOS X
	 without needing to be told.

2006-01-23 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.9 release.

2006-01-22 John Elliott

	* Some minor code changes which should allow JOYCE to be built on
	 MacOS X (though still as a very UNIXy app)
	* Modfied SDLTerm so that it doesn't do a SDL_UpdateRect for each
	 character in a string. 

2005-12-15 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.8 release.

	* Added support for LibDsk's rcpmfs feature, allowing directories
	 on the host system to be presented as disc images. This applies 
	 both to emulated floppy and emulated hard drives. As a side-effect
	 of this, extra floppy drives provided by JOYCEDRV.FID now recognise
	 disc images in the CPC System and Data formats.

2005-04-23 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.7 release.

	* Reinstated native GSX support, which was dropped when JOYCE for DOS 
	 was ported to UNIX. GEM driver source (released under the GPL) has 
	 been used to try and ensure verisimilitude.

	* Added an 'Actions' menu to switch back to the host system's 
	 screen; useful for dealing with GSX programs like DR Graph that
	 don't tidy up after themselves.

	* Fixed the native LOGO driver so that it works; it had not displayed
	 any graphics since JOYCE 2.0.0.

	* Synced with LibDsk 1.1.4.

2005-01-30 John Elliott

	* Switched configure.in so the default is to use the host system's
	 STL rather than Mini-STL.

	* Synced with LibDsk 1.1.3, Lib765 0.3.3

2004-07-25 John Elliott

	* Bug fix: JOYCE (Win32) doesn't crash if there are no printers set
	up on the system.

2004-02-21 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.5 release.

	* Various joystick models are emulated.

	* Source updated to compile with SDL-1.26.

2004-01-17 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.4 release.

	* Floppy changeline is now emulated properly.

	* Uses an extension to the .DSK format to distinguish between 720k
	 and 1440k disc images. 

	* Mouse acceleration no longer moves the mouse pointer off the 
	 screen.

2003-12-26 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.3 release.

	* Blank PcW16 floppy images are formatted when they are created.

2003-12-24 John Elliott

	* Various rewrites to the xanne floppy acceleration code, as listed
	 below:
	* Added the ability to save and restore filesystem state, matching
	 what Rosanne does internally with regard to os_typo_*() operations.
	 Rosanne can only open two files at a time (one for read, one for
	 write); so os_typo_*() has to back up the filesystem's internal 
	 variables in case it needs to read a file when there's already a
	 file open for read.
	  Now that AnneAccel does this as well, the FAQ document loads with 
	 no errors.
	* Under Windows, the PcW16FS directory is created in the order in 
	 which it should appear. This is the opposite order to the one you
	 have to use under Linux.
	* Rewrote findfile() to use Win32 functions directly rather than
	 the C library. The WP can now create files without a spurious 'file 
	 exists already' warning.
	* os_close_file now works even if the currently selected device is
	 not the floppy. This allows more than one file to be copied from
	 flash to floppy in one go.

2003-12-22 John Elliott

	* Fixed dg_blk_copy and dg_blk_move acceleration in xanne. The word
	 processor now scrolls correctly.

2003-12-21 John Elliott

	* Replaced incorrect drivers.inc in LibDsk and fixed reading code
	 in Lib765, allowing the use of .CFI files in xanne as documented.

2003-12-20 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.2 release.

	* Added Rosanne acceleration.

	* Code revisions to compile on systems with full STL rather than
	 mini-STL.

2002-09-28 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.1 release.

	* Bug fix: PCW9512 printer output to Windows GDI was using the
	 wrong font size.

	* Bug fixes in the Z80 source for the boot ROM and export utility.

2002-08-30 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.1.0 release.

	 blank.

2002-02-15 John Elliott

	* joyce-2.0.0 release.

	* joyce-1.9.4 release.

	* Daisywheel printer emulation added.

	* Bugfixes in the 100x36 text screen.

	* COM port support for Windows (output only and buggy). 

	* Floppy controller emulation now supports creation and formatting
	 of new .DSK files within JOYCE.

2001-10-20 John Elliott

	* joyce-1.9.3 release.

        * Bugfix: DirectX crash on termination.

	* Floppy disc controller emulation now uses libdsk, so direct access
	 to floppy drives is possible.
	
2001-09-15 John Elliott

	* joyce-1.9.2 release.

        * Bugfixes in the Win32 file selector.

        * JoycePrinter.cxx: Bug fix trying to write to the first character
         of an STL string.

	* Uses the mini-STL from MICO, rather than the full STL. This seems
         to improve stability in the Windows version.

1999-05-24 John Elliott

	* joyce v1.33 release.

        port support; this may avoid memory locking error messages.

        * Bug fix in file selector code.

1999-02-20 John Elliott

	* joyce v1.32 release.

	* dprintf() renamed to joyce_dprintf(), to avoid name conflict with 
        libc6.
